abstract: "Recent advances in wireless sensors, mobile technologies, and
cloud computing have made continuous remote monitoring of
patients possible. In this paper, we introduce the design and
implementation of WANDA, an end-to-end remote health
monitoring and analytics system designed for heart failure
patients. The system consists of a smartphone-based data
collection gateway, an Internet-scale data storage and search
system, and a backend analytics engine for diagnostic and
prognostic purposes. The system supports the collection of data
from a wide range of sensory devices that measure patients’ vital
signs as well as self-reported questionnaires. The main objective
of the analytics engine is to predict future events by examining
physiological readings of the patients.
We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed analytics engine
using the data gathered from a pilot study of 18 heart failure
patients. In particular, our results show that the advanced analytic
algorithms used in our system are capable of predicting the
worsening of patients’ heart failure symptoms with up to 74%
accuracy while improving the sensitivity performance by more
than 45% compared to the commonly used thresholding algorithm
based on daily weight change. Moreover, the accuracy attained by
our system is only 9% lower than the theoretical upper bound. The
proposed framework is currently deployed in a large ongoing
heart failure study that targets 1500 congestive heart failure
patients."
