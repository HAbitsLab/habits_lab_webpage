abstract: "Sleep plays a pivotal role in the quality of life,
and sleep posture is related to many medical conditions such
as sleep apnea. In this paper, we design a dense pressuresensitive bedsheet for sleep posture monitoring. In contrast to
existing techniques, our bedsheet system offers a completely
unobtrusive method using comfortable textile sensors. Based
on high-resolution pressure distributions from the bedsheet,
we develop a novel framework for pressure image analysis to
monitor sleep postures, including a set of geometrical features
for sleep posture characterization and three sparse classifiers
for posture recognition. We run a pilot study and evaluate
the performance of our methods with 14 subjects to analyze
6 common postures. The experimental results show that our
proposed method enables reliable sleep posture recognition and
offers better overall performance than state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 83.0% precision and 83.2% recall on average.
