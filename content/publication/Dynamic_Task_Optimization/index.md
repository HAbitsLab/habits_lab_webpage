abstract: "Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the
United States, but careful symptom monitoring can prevent
adverse events. A real-time patient monitoring and feedback
system is one of the solutions to help patients with diabetes and
their healthcare professionals monitor health-related
measurements and provide dynamic feedback. However, datadriven
methods to dynamically prioritize and generate tasks
are not well investigated in the domain of remote health
monitoring. This paper presents a wireless health project
(WANDA) that leverages sensor technology and wireless
communication to monitor the health status of patients with
diabetes. The WANDA dynamic task management function
applies data analytics in real-time to discretize continuous
features, applying data clustering and association rule mining
techniques to manage a sliding window size dynamically and to
prioritize required user tasks. The developed algorithm
minimizes the number of daily action items required by
patients with diabetes using association rules that satisfy a
minimum support, confidence and conditional probability
thresholds. Each of these tasks maximizes information gain,
thereby improving the overall level of patient adherence and
satisfaction. Experimental results from applying EM-based
clustering and Apriori algorithms show that the developed
algorithm can predict further events with higher confidence
levels and reduce the number of user tasks by up to 76.19 %."
