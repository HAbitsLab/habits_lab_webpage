abstract: "Patient monitoring systems are becoming
increasingly important in accurately diagnosing and treating
growing worldwide chronic conditions especially the obesity
epidemic. The ubiquitous nature of wearable sensors, such as
the readily available embedded accelerometers in smart
phones, provides physicians with an opportunity to remotely
monitor their patientâ€™s daily activity. There have been several
developments in the area of activity recognition using wearable
sensors. However, due to power constraints, resource efficient
algorithms are necessary in order to perform accurate realtime activity recognition while consuming minimal energy. In
this paper, we present a two-tier architecture for optimizing
power consumption in such systems. While the first tier relies
on a hierarchical classification approach, the second one
manages the activation and deactivation of the classification
system. We demonstrate this using a series of binary Support
Vector Machine classifiers. The proposed approach, however,
is classifier independent. Experimenting with subjects
performing different daily activities such as walking, going upstairs and down-stairs, standing and sitting, our approach
achieves a power savings of 87%, while maintaining 92%
classification accuracy."
